# Dog Image Classification

### Overview

In this project, first face classification was done uisng the haarcascade.
The second task was to predict through the VGG16 model and predict a class by giving
an image.
The third task was to give build a CNN model from Scratch.
The fourth task was to use transfer learning for prediction. Used the VGG19 for that.
Removed the last layer and added a linear layer.
